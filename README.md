			My TIC TAC TOE
	
	This is a game of tic tac toe that can be played with a 3x3 or a 5x5
board. After you first choose the dimension of the board you can choose to play
against another person or the computer.
	The computer has 2 difficulties. On "EASY" the computer makes random
moves, while on "HARD" it plays relatively better, making plays based on the
minimax algorithm. For the 5x5 board, the computer can only see a few moves
ahead, the depth increases as the game progresses. Given its limited view, in
the begining is the easiest to beat it, so the challenge is to improve the
moves as to increase the chances of the computer to last longer, until it can
calculate the best moves to avoid defeat.
